### XZ Backdoor Research:

#### Summary:
Malicious code was added to xz Utils versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1, creating a backdoor that manipulated sshd, the executable file used for remote access. This vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-3094 with a CVSS score of 10, resulted from a software supply chain compromise. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommended organizations to downgrade to a previous non-compromised version of XZ Utils.

#### Remediation Steps:
1. Immediately downgrade xz to an earlier version (5.4.6 is the latest unaffected version in most distributions).
2. After downgrading xz, reboot the machine or restart the OpenSSH server to remove the patched code from memory (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart ssh`).

#### Recommendation:
Check the XZ version carefully, as versions 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 contain the backdoor. It is advised to revert to a previous known safe version of XZ Utils, such as 5.4.
